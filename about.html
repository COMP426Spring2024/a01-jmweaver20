    <p>Arachne, her name meaning spider in Greek, was a woman in mythology who had 
        a great skill in weaving. Many marveled at her work, but her ego got the best of her.
        In a protest of pride, she claimed that she was the greatest weaver of all, claiming that
        she could even best the goddess Athena. Offended at this, Athena transformed arachne into a spider,
        cursed to weave her entire life.The claim of superior weaving came from a weaving contest. Like many mortals, Arachne was
        prone to arrogance, and she became tired and irritated of people calling her the pupil of Athena.
        As a result, Athena cast herself as a mortal woman, and aimed to give Arachne a second chance to rectify
        her arrogance. Arachne paid no mind to the caution, and Athena revealed her true form, stunning
        onlookers and passerbys alike. Their stage was set, mortal versus God, and each began weaving. Many were horrified
        that Arachne would even take the challenge, but she was stubborn and steadfast and the competition continued.
        The two battled for long, each at their looms producing unimaginable and beautiful tapestries.

        Athena created a tapestry which had scenes from the history of the gods. Her work portrayed Zeus in Olympus,
        as well as Athena's own trials with Poseidon and her subsequent victory. At the corner of Athena's tapestry,
        she cleverly displayed the humans who have defied God's before and the wrath they faced without a trace of mercy.
        Arachne, on the other hand, deliberate in her craft, chose to depict the infedelities and amours of the Gods. She
        captured Zeus and his string of affairs and missteps. Arachne's work consisted of many depictions of the gods commiting their
        misdemeanors and she made sure to include Poseidon, Apollo, and Dionysus. Though Arachne's work was flawless, and even made Athena admire, it did little to cool her rage that she felt after
        Arachne had mocked the god's in her work. As punishment, Athena destroyed both her loom and tapestry, and made her into a spider, a 
        humiliation and mockery of Arachne's talent and skill as a weaver. Arachne's story stands to tell a lesson in humility and respect - and has been
        immortalized in science and studies who often use the taxonomical name 'Arachnida' for spiders.
